Built to celebrate the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Ford Motor Company, the Ford GT borrows many design elements from the GT40, a car that famously swept the podium in the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance racing championship.  A new generation of the Ford GT is currently in the works so we shall see how it stacks up to its predecessors.</p>"
