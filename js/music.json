		"<p>Behold!  My high school band in its debut performance!  Known as the <i>Four-Day Forecast</i> (since we were actually just a quartet), we played at all kinds of places from summer concerts to holiday parties!  Our greatest song was a cover of &#8220Blue Rondo Ã  la Turk&#8221, a song made famous by Dave Brubeck.</p>",

I usually resorted to making car sounds and sirens much to the delight of the children.</p><p>Photo credit: Leah Rosin</p>",
		"<p>What&#8217s this?  A haircut?  <i>*Gasp!</i>  Some time between being a freshman and a sophomore, I decided that I no longer wanted to look like a 70s rock star.  And so, out came the clippers.  Having experienced peripheral vision for the first time in years, here I am playing at a casual &#8220brown bag lunch&#8221 at the University of Pittsburgh student union building.</p>",
