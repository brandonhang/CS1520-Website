<p>This website was made as the primary project for the University of Pittsburgh course CS 1520, <i>Programming Languages for Web Applications.</i>  Unless otherwise noted below, all assets were created by me.  The flying kick, toy store, and <i>Jazz Circus</i> photographs were taken by Shana Fowler Crouse.  The graduation drumming photograph was probably taken by someone from Lifetouch.  The Pitt Jazz concert photograph was taken by someone from the University of Pittsburgh Department of Music.  The Jamaica trombone photograph was taken by Leah Rosin.  The first brown bag lunch photograph was taken by a member of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.  The second brown bag lunch photograph was taken by Lucas Felak.  The Pitt Jazz Ensemble photograph was taken by a member of the Pitt News.  All other photographs that I appear in were taken by a member of my awesome family.</p>
