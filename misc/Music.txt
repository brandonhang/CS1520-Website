<p>Playing music, my oldest and most beloved pastime, has taken me on many a journey between cities, across state lines, and even international boundaries!  Like I said earlier, it all started in 4<sup>th</sup> grade when I was given my first instrument.  Performance-wise, my first love still is, and will always be, jazz.  Influenced from a young age by my father, I grew up listening to the music of Dave Brubeck and Miles Davis and quickly developed a taste for the genre.  As I grew older, it was through performing jazz that I was able to experience many different places and cultures.  In recent years, I also rediscovered the joy in performing classical piano.  <i>*Sniff*</i>, my old piano teacher would be so proud!  After visiting Jamaica with the Pitt Jazz Ensemble, I began enjoying reggae as well.  There was just something about experiencing music at its origin that really touched my soul.  Recently, on the whim of a friend to be wed, I took to singing as well.  Well, it took quite a bit of coaxing as I had never sung before an audience in my life!  No, elementary school choir does <i>not</i> count!  In the end, my first vocal performance was an entire concert in front of a packed wedding reception!  And it was a hit!</p>
