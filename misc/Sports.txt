<p>Unfortunately, there&#39s not much I have to say regarding sports.  If you clicked this section to read a captivating anecdote, then I am sorry to say that you will be disappointed.  Nevertheless, I grew up playing soccer, or <i>futbol</i> for you international folk, as a child and picked up basketball for a couple years in middle school.  In my later years, I developed a liking to tennis as well.   Despite my vertical shortcomings and limited skillset, I am a basketball player at heart.  I live and breathe the NBA, hearing news in the league before it even becomes news.  Well, I guess it isn&#39t <i>that</i> farfetched.  I did make the All-Star team in my short-lived middle school career.</p>
