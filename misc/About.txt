<p>&#8220;Why do we fall, Bruce?  So we can learn to pick ourselves up.&#8221;  Fans of the Batman films will instantly recognize this line spoken by Bruce Wayne&#39s father in <i>Batman Begins</i>.  Over the years, this quote has become somewhat of a personal mantra of mine; it reminds me that regardless of the adversity I may face, I can persevere as long as I have strength to soldier on.  My name is Brandon S. Hang and this is my story.</p>
<p>The elder son of refugees from the Vietnam War, I was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, a place I still call home.  I grew up as any typical child might have in the suburbs of Harrisburg: a handful of organized team sports, a sprinkling of video games, and a light dusting of mischief.  However, it was in the 4th grade where I would be introduced to my love affair with music.</p>
<p>My first instrument was a King 606 trombone, a shiny, gold hunk of brass that was nearly as tall as I was!  This behemoth was a struggle just to carry around school!  I got over it though (eh, maybe not...) and everything cascaded from there.  I picked up the saxophone in 6th grade followed by the piano in 8th grade.  I even learned to play the drums in high school!  I joined numerous pit orchestras, played in a number of regional and state bands, and even had my own jazz combo in high school.</p>
<p>After graduating from high school, I enrolled (for the first time) as an undergraduate at the University of Pittsburgh, originally for pharmacy.  Well, things changed and I switched my major to biology with the intent of entering some sort of professional healthcare school afterwards.  Throughout my years of study at Pitt, I enjoyed new hobbies, such as taekwondo and digital media creation, and rediscovered my love for playing tennis and basketball.  I was even fortunate enough to travel to Jamaica with the Pitt Jazz Ensemble to play for underprivileged middle and high school students.</p>
<p>I graduated from Pitt in 2008 with a B.S. in Biological Sciences and quickly earned a M.S. in Biology from Shippensburg University in 2013.  This marked a major turning point in my life.  During that time, I juggled different career paths along with unemployment.  One minute, I was in quality control for a food manufacturing plant and the next I was a certified nursing assistant in a bid for physician assistant schools.  In any case, I was never truly satisfied with how my story was unfolding and that I could not find the stability that I sought.</p>
<p>And so, I finally decided to return to school in 2015, to a place I knew I&#39d return to someday.  That place is the University of Pittsburgh, a place where I can start over and get that second chance so few ever get.  After all, the great philosopher Iroh once spoke, &#8220Life happens wherever you are, whether you make it or not,&#8221 so why not make something of it?  My name is Brandon S. Hang.  I am a computer science student at the University of Pittsburgh and I can't wait to see where this road takes me.</p>
