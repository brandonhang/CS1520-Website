<p>Anyone who knows me knows that I am a real car nut, a diehard petrolhead, an automotive <i>fanatic</i>.  I don&#39t know exactly when the bug bit me, but I seemingly turned overnight.  For me, automobiles are more than just a 2 ton steel appliance that shuttle you from point A to point B.  To me, automobiles carry personalities that are often conveyed in their owners.  Some cars are temperamental, refusing to go out if there&#39s even a single drop of rain.  Some are loud and rude and always angry at the world, shouting at the top of their (mechanical) lungs.  Others have a bit more self-control and only get riled up when pressed.  In any case, I enjoy cars from every era.  From the classic pony cars of yesteryear, to the ludicrously-priced and ludicrously powerful European exotics, and even the Japanese street legends of humble origins, I&#39m a fan of it all.</p>
