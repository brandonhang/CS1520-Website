<p>Digital media.  What is it?  Well, it&#39s something that I enjoy creating, that’s for sure.  Ranging from music albums, digital art, extremely amateur photography, and the occasional video or two, there is much that I like to dabble in.  Things began back in 2007 when high school English class group (yes, I am that old) was tasked with producing a video adaptation of a story from <i>The Canterbury Tales</i>, by Geoffrey Chaucer.  As is par for the course for me, we went way overboard in this production; what was only required to be 8 minutes ended up being a full 20 minute long filled with humor, action, and tragedy.  Up until my teacher’s retirement, our video would still be played every year for each incoming class.  After that, I&#39ve created more videos, produced music, created cover art for said music and videos, and even took up (I repeat, extremely amateur) photography in my free time.</p>
