			<h3>Changes and Enhancements</h3>
			<p>
				<span class="tab"></span>I made many changes and enhancements in part 2 of my project
				(more than I thought) I could come up with.  The biggest change is that I switched to
				using SASS to precompile my CSS.  I wish I had learned of this sooner because being able
				to nest styles, use variables, and include mixins (which are <i>super awesome</i>) is not
				only convenient but just plain makes sense.  I also took advantage of media queries to
				deliver content based on the width of the browser.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="tab"></span>I revamped the Programming section to be more interactive,
				informative, and less <i>blah</i>.  I created a GitHub user card that is inspired by
				social media accounts and the Xbox 360 Gamertag.  It also uses the GitHub API v3 in order
				to deliver up-to-date profile images and repo/follower stats.  I also used the D3 jQuery
				plugin to build a horizontal tree of my past CS projects at Pitt.  I didn&#8217t really
				modify the tree script as previous attempts to refactor it went horribly and the
				documentation for this particular structure was either non-existent or very well hidden.
				I resigned to simply changing the tree to a fixed size and modifying the colors of the
				nodes/branches.  The tree uses a JSON object that I wrote to include all the relevant
				branches, urls, and descriptions.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="tab"></span>The next major section I enhanced was the Interests section.
				I removed the &#8220Sports&#8221 and &#8220Media&#8221 sections as I no longer needed to
				fluff up the section with extra content.  I used the Slick jQuery carousel plugin to generate
				2 carousels for &#8220Music&#8221 and &#8220Cars&#8221.  Each subsection also uses JSON
				objects I wrote to pull images, thumbnails, and descriptions for each slide.  Like the D3
				plugin, I also found the documentation for Slick to be lacking.  However, I was able to
				create carousels that were mostly in line with what I had in mind.  I originally thought
				about using a carousel within a carousel but decided against it as it might have made for
				an inferior mobile experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="tab"></span>I updated the &#8220Contact&#8221 section to submit messages without
				requiring a page refresh.  I also slightly changed the layout and included Google&#8217s
				Recaptcha service.  However, for security reasons, I did not include the PHP file with my
				private RSA key so messages will not send successfully.  You can try, but my website will yell
				at you and accuse you of either being a Terminator or an Agent of the <span class="green">Matrix</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="tab"></span>Some other minor changes include enhancements of the navigation bar,
				the site information popup, and the footer.  The navigation bar now fades in a blue background
				once the user scrolls past a certain number of pixels.  The site information popup
				was modified to fit on screens of small resolution sizes.  The footer now contains a
				row of external links as buttons.  There might be 1 or 2 Easter eggs found here&#8230
			</p>
			<h3>Part 3 Thoughts</h3>
			<p>
				<span class="tab"></span>I honestly have <i>no idea</i> what I would do if there was a Part 3.
				I already had a hard enough time coming up with ideas for Part 2.  I guess if I were to do
				something, it would be adding some more interactive tooltips perhaps.  It would be
				neat if hovering over certain keywords resulted in a tooltip appearing with some
				extra images not found in the carousels.  It would also be nice if my media queries worked
				with mobile device ppi rather than pixels.  That way, the proper version is sent to phones
				that nowadays have very high pixel counts.  I also wanted to embed a YouTube video
				in one of my carousels but it unfortunately introduced trackers and ads to my site.
				<b>AND THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE!</b>
			</p>
			<h3>What I Learned</h3>
			<p>
				<span class="tab"></span>It&#8217s hard to say what exactly I learned between Parts 1 and 2
				as I sort of worked on both parts concurrently.  So instead, I&#8217ll simply try to
				describe what I learned overall&#8230which happens to be everything.  I started this
				project not knowing how to write a single line of HTML and now I can confidently say
				that I built a website from scratch.  No Bootstrap necessary.
			</p>
			<h3>Project Dis/Likes</h3>
			<p><span class="tab"></span>I am someone who enjoys building things in any format (Legos,
				woodworking, Gundam models, etc.) so building a website was no different.  I also liked
				the fact that this website is something I can (and plan to) put up on the Internet eventually,
				perhaps by this summer even.
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="tab"></span>I didn&#8217t particularly enjoy the lack of structure with this
				project.  It was far too open-ended for someone who was a rookie web developer.  In these
				situations, I often feel that smaller steps put less pressure on newcomers as it allows
				them to feel they are progressing towards something.  I know the exercises were meant to do
				that but I didn&#8217t feel as if they tied in that well with building a website.
